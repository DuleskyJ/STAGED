Here lies Project #2 where we created a platform for all the ragers! 
We wanted to appeal to CROWDS & where are usually crowds? Out partying at a music festival/concert.
Our application, "STAGED", allows users to plan out their day(s) worth of vibing accordingly so they can make sure nothing is missed!
With our awesome graphical interface, account creation & data saving features. You will no longer fear the FOMO!

We started off strong creating a wirefame off of the home image which gave us inspiration for the name. 
With Coachella starting tomorrow we came up with a useful idea that'll remain relevant. 
Then we finalized on the technologies that we will be using to then implement a system where users can create their own events & store necessary information such as timing. 

Instructions to use is fairly easy once you have it deployed there is a create/login button centered on the screen.
Once you input your account information you'll then be presented with an "ADD EVENT+" button on the top left of the page under STAGED. 
From there all the magic happens where the user fills out 5 details that'll be saved and displayed as cards. 
Making it both convenient and accessible during high-intensity times.
We also found that it helps organize multi-stage events such as Coachella :)!
