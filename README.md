Here lies Project #2 where we created a platform for all the ragers! 
We wanted to appeal to CROWDS & where are usually crowds? Out partying at a music festival/concert. 
Our application, "STAGED", allows users to plan out their day(s) worth of vibing accordingly so they can make sure nothing is missed! 
With our awesome graphical interface, account creation & data saving features. You will no longer fear the FOMO! 

We started off strong creating a wirefame off of the home image which gave us inspiration for the name. 
With Coachella starting tomorrow we came up with a useful idea that'll remain relevant. 
Then we finalized on the technologies that we will be using to then implement a system where users can create their own events & store necessary information such as timing. 
It even has authorization so make sure to create your account first! 

Instructions to use is fairly easy once you have it deployed there is a create/login panel centered on the screen. 
You can switch between the two on the top right. 
Once you input your account information you'll then be presented with an "ADD EVENT+" button on the top left of the page under STAGED. 
From there all the magic happens where the user fills out 5 details that'll be saved and displayed as cards. 
Making it both convenient and accessible during high-intensity times. 
We also found that it helps organize multi-stage events such as Coachella :)!
